## Makes mailing list archives look good for moderm web browsers

Once upon a time, everybody on the internet had displays that were around 80 characters wide. They surfed the web using lynx, did their email with mail, and happily mixed up their formatting with their presentation to break any device that was more or less than 80-ish characters wide.

Deneckbeard automatically finds mailing list archives, and turns 80-character formatted text into actual paragraph elements, formatted for readability. Ie, __text looks like text, not code__

__It leaves actual code on regular websites alone.__

## Install Instructions

 - Download the [Deneckbeard zip file](https://github.com/mikemaccana/deneckbeard/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
 - Visit [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
 - Click 'Load Unpacked Extension'

Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **reload any existing tabs**.
